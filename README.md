# HR-Management-System-
In a normal HR Management System, the employee tracking system
becomes very tough. The employee data is stored in different locations so
it gets tough for the department to manage the employee details due to
different locations. But, our system focuses on maintaining and accessing
the database from one location. It also simplifies employee management
processes. Our system also enables enterprise mobility. Our application
also calculates utilization of each employee and we also created a
dynamic graph to monitor the utilization.
